  # HRMSystem React.js Project README
    
    Welcome to our HRMSystem React.js project! This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.
    
    ## Getting Started
    
    Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.
    
    ### Prerequisites
    
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer
    
    ### Installation
    
    1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/karin1997/HRSystemReactjs.git
    
    2. Navigate to the project directory:
            cd your-react-project
    
    3. Install project dependencies using npm:
            npm install
    
    Note: You may encounter compatibility issues with peer dependencies while installing packages. If you encounter such issues, use the following command to install dependencies:
            npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    
    4. Running the Project
    Once you've installed the project dependencies, you can start the development server with the following command:
            npm start
    
    
    This will start the React development server, and your app should be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:3000/. The page will automatically reload if you make edits to the source code.
